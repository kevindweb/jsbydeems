This will be coming very soon. This is my first full MEAN Stack application, with the exception of Angular for styling and animation.
The application will allow you to sign up with expressJS and mongoDB, log in using your credentials, set a list of passwords that will be encrypted, 
and then upload files and text to the database that will also be hidden using hashing and salting.
